# Introduction

MdPress is composed of two parts: a [minimalistic static site generator](https://github.com/docschina/mdpress/tree/master/packages/%40mdpress/core) with a React-powered [theming system](../theme/README.md) and [Plugin API](../plugin/README.md), and a [default theme](../theme/default-theme-config.md) optimized for writing technical documentation. It was created to support the documentation needs of YinJiZhongWen’s own sub projects.

Each page generated by MdPress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Yet, once the page is loaded, React takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Extra pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.

## How It Works

A MdPress site is in fact a SPA powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/)、[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/). If you’ve used React before, you will notice the familiar development experience when you are writing or developing custom themes (you can even use React DevTools to debug your custom theme!).

During the build, we create a server-rendered version of the app and render the corresponding HTML by virtually visiting each route. This approach is inspired by [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)'s `nuxt generate` command and other projects like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and Vuepress.

Each Markdown file is compiled into HTML with [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and then processed as the template of a React component. This allows you to directly use React inside your Markdown files and is great when you need to embed dynamic content.

## Why Not ...?

### Nuxt

Nuxt is capable of doing what MdPress does, but it’s designed for building applications. MdPress is focused on content-centric static sites and provides features tailored for technical documentation out of the box.

### Docsify / Docute

Both are great projects are both fully runtime-driven and therefore not SEO-friendly. If you don’t care for SEO and don’t want to mess with installing dependencies, these are still great choices.

### Hexo

in fact, we are probably still a long way to go from migrating away from it for our main site. The biggest problem is that its theming system is static and string-based - we want to take advantage of React for both the layout and the interactivity. Also, Hexo’s Markdown rendering isn’t the most flexible to configure.

### GitBook

We’ve been using GitBook for most of our sub project docs. The primary problem with GitBook is that its development reload performance is intolerable with a large amount of files. The default theme also has a pretty limiting navigation structure, and the theming system is, again, not React based. The team behind GitBook is also more focused on turning it into a commercial product rather than an open-source tool.
